The Programmer's Guide is not available yet. I plan to start working
on it real soon and want to have a first version finished in the
Aug/Sept 2002 timeframe. This version will have to be purchased.

<br/>
In the meantime, since the concepts underlying the architecture of
JGroups have not changed much, I suggest to check out the User's
Guide for version 1.0 of JGroups since it also contains some
architectural discussion.
