JGroups is open source licensed under the Library (or Lesser) GNU Public
License 2.1 <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-license.php">(LGPL)</a>.

<p/>
A commercial product can use JGroups (as a library) without
having to become open source under the LGPL. (This is the big
difference to the GPL, where applications using it must be licensed
under the GPL as well.) So, if you for example use JGroups to write
a product for clustering an application server, you can sell this product
without any restrictions (ship it with JGroups included) and you
do <em>not</em> have to make your application open source.
