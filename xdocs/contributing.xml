<section name="Contributing to JGroups">
<p>
There are various ways to contribute:
<ul>
<li>If you find a bug, please either fix it (best case !) and send a
patch, or at least create a bug report so we know about the bug.
If you find that you fix a number of bugs, we may promote you to CVS
committer (if you want to), so that you can fix bugs directly.
</li>
<li>Write some documentation. Example: how to set up JGroups using
JBuilder, or how to configure JGroups on a NIC-less notebook</li>
<li>Create unit tests. These are very essential: we run the testcase
suite before each new release to make sure previously fixed bugs don't
show up again. Having a lot of unit tests helps us save time.</li>
<li>Suggest new features</li>
</ul>
