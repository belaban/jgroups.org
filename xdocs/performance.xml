<section name="Latest perf tests Oct 2008">
<p>
Quick update: on my home cluster (4 HP 4-core blades, 1GB switch), I
achieved (on a 4 node cluster, 4 senders, udp.xml, everyone sends 5
million 1K messages for a total of 20 million messages) <b>136'000 1K messages/sec/node</b> !
</p>
<p>
I'll re-run the same tests as below in the same lab and test
environment a bit later this year and publish some final numbers
here. I assume I'll get even better throughput when I increase
message size from 1K to 2.5 and 5K, as in the tests below !
</p>
<p>
Okay, done: I re-ran the above tests with 1K, 2.5K and 5K
messages. The throughputs
are <b>137 MB/sec/node</b>, <b>150 MB/sec/node</b>
and <b>153 MB/sec/node</b> ! I assume we get even better perf by
changing to jumbo frames (e.g. MTUs of 8K).

The test report can be found <a
href="perf/perf2008/Report.html">here</a>. It measures performance of
sending 1 million messages in clusters of 4, 6, 8 and 10 nodes. The
protocol stacks compared are UDP and TCP.
