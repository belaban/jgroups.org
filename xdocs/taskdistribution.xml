<section name="A simple clustered task distribution system">
<p>
This is an article on placing a task into a grid (cluster) where it is
picked up and processed by a worker, based on a deterministic
algorithm.<br/>

No task is lost; when a node crashes, the remaining nodes again
deterministically pick a worker which processes the task again.<br/>

There is no single point of failure, and nodes can be
added (e.g. to accommodate more load) and removed without interruption of the system.

The article can be found at 
<a href="taskdistribution/TaskDistribution.pdf">here</a> (PDF)
and <a href="taskdistribution/TaskDistribution.html">here</a> (HTML).
