<section name="Contributing Money to JGroups">
<p>
JGroups is currently run on the side (nights and weekends) since
I'm a full-time employee. This leaves me with less time than I wish I
had to spend on the project.
<br/>
</p>

<p>
Therefore, if you like JGroups and would like to contribute money
to it, please press the PayPal button below and donate some money to
the project.
<br/>
</p>

<p>
This will allow me to take some unpaid time off every now and then and
work full-time on JGroups, e.g. fixing bugs, implementing new
features etc. Please contact <a href="mailto:belaban@yahoo.com">me</a>
if you prefer other methods of payment.
