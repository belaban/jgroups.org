<h1>Performance tests JGroups 2.5<br>
</h1>
<br>
Author: Bela Ban<br>
Date: June 2007<br>
<br>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<br>
The tests were conducted in the JBoss lab in Atlanta. Each box was:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Dell PE1850 2x 3Ghz EM64T processors<br>
  </li>
  <li>4GB memory</li>
  <li>Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 4<br>
  </li>
  <li>OS: Linux 2.6.9-42.0.10.smp<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<div class="section" lang="en"><br>
The tests were run only on 64-bit systems.<br>
<br>
<h3>Switches</h3>
The following switch was used:<br>
<ul>
  <li>1GBps: <a
 href="http://docs.us.dell.com/support/edocs/network/5P788/en/ug/pc5224c1.htm">Dell
Power Connect 5224</a> (24 port gige L2 managed switch) with jumbo
frames enabled. All NICs had MTUs of 9000 bytes.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Network</h3>
Note that neither the network nor the test machines were reserved
exclusively for the performance tests, so some of<br>
the fluctuations are explained by the fact that other users/processes
were using the machines and/or generating traffic on<br>
the network. This was mitigated somewhat by running all tests in the AM
hours (8am - 3pm) in Europe, when the servers in<br>
Atlanta GA were mostly idle. We also used machine which have no cron
jobs (like cruisecontrol etc) scheduled that could interfere<br>
with the tests.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>JVM configuration</h3>
The following JVMs were used:<br>
<ul>
  <li>SUN JDK 1.5.0_11-b03</li>
</ul>
The options used for starting the JVMs were:<br>
-server -Xmn300M -Xmx400M -Xms400M -XX:+UseParallelGC
-XX:+AggressiveHeap -XX:CompileThreshold=100 -XX:SurvivorRatio=8
-XX:TargetSurvivorRatio=90 -XX:MaxTenuringThreshold=31
-Dlog4j.configuration=file:/home/bela/log4j.properties
-Djgroups.bind_addr=${MYTESTIP_1} -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote
-Dresolve.dns=false<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Design of the tests</h2>
The goal of the test is to measure the time it takes to reliably send N
messages to all nodes in a cluster. (We are currently not interested in
measuring remote group RPC, this may be done in a future performance
test.) The test works as follows. <br>
<ul>
  <li>All members have access to 2 configuration files: one for
defining the number of messages to be sent, the number of cluster
members, senders etc, and the other one defining the JGroups protocol
stack.</li>
  <li>N processes are started. They can be started on the same machine,
but for better results there is one JGroups process per box</li>
  <li>The processes join the same group, and when N equals the cluster
size defined in the configuration file, all senders start sending M
messages to the cluster (M is also defined in the configuration file).</li>
  <li>Every node in the cluster receives the messages (senders are also
receivers). When the first message is received, the clock is started.
When the last message is received the clock is stopped. Every member
know how many messages are to be received: &lt;number of senders&gt;
*&nbsp; &lt;number of messages&gt;. This allows every receiver to
compute the message rate and throughput (we also know the size of each
message).</li>
</ul>
The test is part of JGroups: org.jgroups.tests.perf.Test. The driver is
JGroups independent and can also be used to measure JMS performance and
pure UDP or TCP performance (all that needs to be done is to write a
Transport interface implementation, with a send() and a receive()).<br>
<br>
The configuration file (config.txt) is shown below (only the JGroups
configuration is shown):<br>
<small><small><small><samp><code><br>

<br>
# Number of messages a sender sendes<br>
num_msgs=1000000<br>
<br>
# Message size in bytes<br>

This file must be the same for all nodes, so it is suggested to place
it in a shared file system, e.g. an NFS mounted directory.<br>

The files needed to run te tests are included with JGroups (source
distribution) as well: JGroups/conf/config.txt is the test
configuration
file, and JGroups/conf/{udp,sfc,tcp}.xml are the JGroups protocol stack
config files. Note that all the test runs will have the JGroups stack
configuration file included so that they can be reproduced.<br>

<br>
<h2>Results</h2>
The plain results are available <a href="4/">here </a>for the
4 node
cluster, <a href="6/">here </a>for the 6 node cluster and <a
 href="8/">here </a>for the 8 node cluster. The OpenOffice
spreadsheet containing all results can be obtained <a
 href="charts/perf.ods">here</a>. <br>
The performance
tests were run on the 3 clusters, measuring message rate (messages
received/sec) and throughput (MB received/sec), as described in <a
 href="http://wiki.jboss.org/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=PerfTests">http://wiki.jboss.org/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=PerfTests</a>.<br>
The JGroups configurations used are:<br>
<ul>
  <li>UDP (<a href="udp.xml">udp.xml</a>):
uses IP multicast in the transport, with FC as flow control
implementation<br>
  </li>
  <li>SFC (<a href="sfc.xml">sfc.xml</a>): uses IP multicast in the
transport, with SFC as flow control implementation<br>
  </li>
  <li>TCP (<a href="tcp.xml">tcp.xml</a>): uses
multiple TCP connections in the transport</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Message rate and throughput</h3>
The Y axes define message rate and throughput, and the X axis defines
the message size. The message rate is
computed as &lt;number of messages sent&gt; * &lt;number of senders&gt;
/ &lt;time to receive all messages&gt;. For example, a message rate of
35000 for 1K means that a receiver received 35000 1K messages on
average per second. On average means that - at the end of a test run -
all nodes post their results, which are collected, summed up and
divided by the number of nodes. So if we have 2 nodes, and they post
message rates of 10000 and 20000, the average messsage rate will be
15000.<br>
The throughput is simply the average message rate times the message
size.<br>

<h2>Interpretation of results</h2>
<h3>General</h3>
All of the tests were conducted with a relatively conservative
configuration, which would allow for the tests to be run for an
extended period of time. For example, the number of credits in flow
control was relatively small. Had we set them to a higher value, we
would have probably gotten better results, but the tests would not have
been able to run for an extended period of time without running out of
memory. For instance, the number of credits should be a function of the
group size (more credits for more nodes in the cluster), however, we
used (more or less) the same configuration for all tests. We will
introduce an enhanced version of the flow control protocol which
dynamically adapts credits, e.g. based on free memory, loss rate etc,
in <a href="http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JGRP-2">http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JGRP-2</a>.<br>
<br>
The message rate and throughput is much better for the TCP-based
configuration than for either SFC or FC, in all 3 cluster
configurations (4, 6 and 8 nodes). Although the rate falls with
increasing message size, <span style="font-weight: bold;">throughput </span>actually
increases slightly with increasing message size in all configurations.
Note that for 6 and 8 nodes, TCP has a throughput of around 100MB/sec,
which uses 80% of the gigabit switch's capacity (ca 125MB/sec) !
Compared to a <a
 href="http://www.jgroups.org/javagroupsnew/perf/Report.html">previous
performance test</a>, we increased the MTU of all NICs to 9K and
enabled <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumbo_frame">jumbo frames</a>,
which allows us to send bigger ethernet packets, which positively
affects throughput (not necessarily message rate).<br>
<br>
We attribute the better performance of TCP to the following issues:<br>
<ul>
  <li>The loss rate for IP multicast packets is usually 0%, but when
the switches do start dropping packets, then they drop almost all of IP
multicast packets (80% or so). This leads to retransmission, which is
costly. Currently, we use a static retransmission timeout mechanism,
which doesn't take actual retransmission times into account. This will
be changed in 2.6, where we take <a
 href="http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JGRP-510">retransmission times</a>
and <a href="http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JGRP-511">loss
rate/memory size</a> into account (). The dynamic retransmission
timeouts will allow us to retransmit message faster when everything is
good, and back off when the network is overloaded, similar to <a
 href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff">TCP's
exponential backoff algorithm</a>.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The challenge for the new flow control is to send packets as fast
as possible but not faster than the point where the multicast loss rate
gets significant. A new flow control protocol (scheduled for 2.6 or
2.7) will therefore take loss rate into account and start throttling
senders as soon as the loss rate increases (e.g. by reducing available
credits). This is similar to TCP where the sliding window size is
reduced on packet loss.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<br>
The throughout of UDP/SFC ranges from 20MB/sec for 1K messages to
30MB/sec for 5K messages, regardless of cluster size. In the case of
TCP, throughput increases more with large messages, however we noticed
that the relative throughput decreases with increasing cluster size. We
suspect that throughput for TCP is a function of the cluster size (as
we have a mesh of TCP connections, from everyone to everyone else). It
will be interesting to see how TCP scales in large clusters, compared
to UDP/SFC.<br>
<br>
<br>
Issues:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Static flow control in JGroups: FC doesn't dynamically adjust the
number of credits based on the number of nodes in a cluster, but this
is defined statically in the config file. We suspect these settings are
okay for smaller clusters, but would need to be adjusted for larger
clusters. We plan to write a new flow control protocol in <a
 href="http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JGRP-2">JGroups 2.6</a>, which
is based on credits (like the existing one), but also takes into
account latency, message loss and number of retransmissions and free
memory.<br>
  </li>
  <li>No OS/NIC optimizations: in RHEL (and other Linux distributions),
buffer sizes (IP, network card) for incoming packets, and other
parameters can be configured. For example, larger buffer sizes lead to
less chance of losing packets because of full buffers.</li>
  <li>No switch optimization: we used the GB switch unchanged and
haven't yet investigated switch tuning. For example, if the switch
implements traffic prioritization (e.g. <a
 href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.1p">802.1p</a>), then IP
multicasts have low priority. Same goes for <a
 href="http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/473/22.html">IGMP snooping</a>:
when enabled, it slows the switch/router down because each single
multicast packet has to be examined for whether it is an IGMP packet,
or just a regular multicast packet. If disabled, the multicasts would
be copied to all ports, which doesn't matter in our test because all
ports have 1 multicast member connected.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Logging: we log performance data to disk every N messages
(default=100000). During the tests we logged to an NFS mounted file
system, which incurs one RPC. It would have been better to log to a
local disk (e.g. /tmp), but we didn't want to change the tests half-way
through<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Processing of messages and scalability</h3>
The <a href="http://wiki.jboss.org/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=PerfTests">test
program</a> currently doesn't do any processing at the receiver when a
message is received. Instead, a message counter is increased and the
size added to the total number of messages received so far. This is of
course an ideal situation, and not realistic for normal use, where
receivers might unmarshal the message's byte buffer into something
meaningful (e.g. an HTTP session), and process it (e.g. updating an
HTTP session). (The test by the way allows to take processing time at
the receiver into account by setting the processing_delay value). <br>
<br>
JGroups 2.5 should process messages which are handled by receivers
(that do some processing on reception of a message) much better, as we
introduced the concurrent stack in 2.5. Preliminary measurements show
that the performance speedup compared to 2.4 (a) for messages which
take some time (a few milliseconds) to process and (b) for clusters
where everyone sends messages, <span style="font-weight: bold;">is
close to N</span> where N is the number of nodes sending messages. We
will publish numbers for these types of scenarios later.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Fluctuation of results (reproduceability)</h3>
Compared to the <a
 href="http://www.jgroups.org/javagroupsnew/perf/Report.html">2.4
performance tests</a>, we didn't run the tests multiple times. Instead,
we ran each test only once, so the numbers shown are not averaged over
multiple runs of a given test. We also didn't adjust the JGroups
configs for the different cluster sizes. For example, the number of
credits in flow control (FC and SFC) should have been increased with
increasing cluster size. However, we wanted to see whether we get <span
 style="font-style: italic;">reasonable numbers for the same configs
run on different clusters</span>. <br>
<br>
If you run the perf tests yourself and get even better numbers
(sepecially for UDP/SFC), we'd be interested to hear from you !<br>
<br>
<h2>Conclusion and outlook</h2>
We showed that performance of JGroups is good for clusters ranging from
4 to 8 nodes. TCP scales better than UDP, however it also creates a
mesh of connections (every sender needs to be connected to everyone
else in the cluster), which may not scale to large clusters.<br>
We intend to measure the performance of larger clusters (16 - 80 nodes)
in a later round of benchmarks.<br>
