<h1>A Generic Management Model for CORBA, CMIP and SNMP</h1>

<font size=+2>T</font>he predominant models to perform network and
systems management have traditionally been SNMP and CMIP. However,
SNMP is beginning to reach its limits when more complex management
tasks are to be performed, and CMIP -- owing to its complexity and
slow standardization process -- has not yet gained the same acceptance
as SNMP.
<p>
<font size=+2>T</font>he advent of object-oriented distributed processing models has
brought forward a third candidate, CORBA, originally not targeted
specifically at management tasks, but in many respects nevertheless
suitable for managing both local and wide area networks.
<p>
<font size=+2>C</font>ORBA is more powerful than SNMP and less complex than CMIP. Its
affiliation with C++, a widely used programming language, lends it to
immediate use by a huge number of programmers and allows them to
introduce distribution into their programs without a too drastic
change of philosophy.
<p>
<font size=+2>I</font>t is therefore assumed that CORBA will become important in the
network and systems management domain as well as in the distributed
systems domain. To be more precise, CORBA will be used to implement
management applications (managers) and managed entities (agents).
<p>
<font size=+2>T</font>he author assumes that, in the near future, all models will have to
coexist, because investments in older models have been made, because
CORBA may not yet be ready for certain specialized management tasks
(e.g. embedded management agents), or simply for political reasons.
<p>
<font size=+2>T</font>herefore, the need arises to manage a system written in <em>one</em>
model from a system written in a <em>different model</em>, for example to
manage an OSI agent using a CORBA-based manager. Assuming that CORBA
will achieve broad acceptance in the management world, it would be
desirable to be able to manage other models transparently from
CORBA. The benefits would be investment protection of existing managed
entities, the opening of the SNMP- and CMIP-dominated management world
to management-inexperienced (CORBA) programmers, and the unification
of management in one common, simple, and yet powerful model.
<p>

<font size=+2>T</font>he goal of this work is to examine how CORBA can be used for network and
systems management. The focus is on the client side; that is, how CORBA can
be used to implement management applications that <em>access</em> managed
entities, rather than how CORBA can be used to <em>implement</em> managed
entities.

<p>
<font size=+2>W</font>ork in this area already exists; an overview will be given and it
will be shown that most work focuses on <em>compile-time static
translation</em> of one model to another. This generates a number of
problems.
<p>
<font size=+2>T</font>herefore a <em>dynamic runtime-based</em> approach is proposed that
eliminates these problems and has several advantages over static
approaches. The proposed model is a combination of a generic object
model, metadata, and adapters that convert between the generic and
specific target models. Although the elements of the proposed models
are established and well known, their combination and their
application to the domain of management is novel and makes for the
issues of interest in this thesis.
